# 🎉 Deployment Fixed and Ready!

## ✅ What Just Happened

We successfully fixed the Vercel build error! Here's what was done:

### 🔧 The Problem
Vercel was trying to install an "editable" Python package from `pyproject.toml`, which caused this error:
```
ERROR: The editable requirement file:///vercel/path0 cannot be installed when requiring hashes
```

### ✨ The Solution
1. ✅ **Deleted** `pyproject.toml` (not needed for deployment)
2. ✅ **Updated** `vercel.json` to use proper configuration
3. ✅ **Pushed** changes to GitHub (commit: b585280)
4. ✅ **Triggered** automatic Vercel redeployment

## 📍 Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Django project created and configured
- [x] GitHub repository created and pushed
