### ❌ **Removed Annoying Alert:**
- ✅ **No more "You can add a maximum of 10 children" alert**

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **Adding Children:**

2. **Only Child 1 form is visible** → Clean, uncluttered interface
3. **Click "Add Another Child"** → Child 2 form appears instantly
4. **Click "Add Another Child"** → Child 3 form appears instantly
5. **Continue clicking** → Up to 10 children can be added
6. **When all 10 are shown** → Add button automatically hides

### **Removing Children:**
1. **Click "Remove Child"** → Form hides (becomes invisible)
2. **Form data is cleared** → Ready for reuse
3. **Add button appears again** → Can add more children
4. **Flexible management** → Add/remove as many times as needed
